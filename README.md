I created a web form to collect the data entered and submitted. I also designed and customized the web form to make it unique. 

My web form conforms to best practices because it is only collecting data that may be useful. Knowing a persons contact information, gender, education level, and region located is very standard. 

Another best practice that I use in my web form is that the questions asked are all relevant to the organization. The questions asked are used for basic context on the person filling it out. 

Lastly, my website conforms to best practices due to the fact that I used a variety of different answer options. My form has text boxes, radio buttons, a dropdown list, as well as checkboxes. Each was utilized in a proper way to ensure data integrity.
